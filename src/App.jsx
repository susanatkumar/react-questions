                  <h2 className='font-medium '>1. What is React? </h2>
                  <p>React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly
                     single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI
                     components that manage their own state and render efficiently when data
                     changes. 
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>2. What is the difference between a function component and a class component in
                     React? 
                  </h2>
                  <p>Function components are simpler and are written as JavaScript functions.
                     They can use hooks for state and lifecycle features. Class components, on the
                     other hand, are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and use methods
                     like render() and lifecycle methods.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>3. What are React Hooks?
                  </h2>
                  <p>React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in
                     function components. Common hooks include: 
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>useState(): For managing state in a function component.</li>
                     <li>useEffect(): For side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, etc. </li>
                     <li>useContext(): To access context data. </li>
                     <li>useReducer(): For more complex state management.</li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>4. What is the Virtual DOM in React?
                  </h2>
                  <p>The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements.
                     React uses it to optimize UI updates by first rendering changes in the virtual
                     DOM and then updating the real DOM only for the changed elements. 
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>5. What are React props and state?
                  </h2>
                  <p>Props: Short for "properties," props are used to pass data from a parent
                     component to a child component. Props are immutable. 
                  </p>
                  <p>State: State is a data structure that represents the componentâ€™s local state. It
                     can be changed over time, and when it changes, the component re-renders.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>6. What is the purpose of useEffect hook in React?
                  </h2>
                  <p>useEffect is used for handling side effects like data fetching, subscriptions,
                     and DOM manipulation in function components. It runs after the render, and
                     you can control when it runs using dependency arrays. 
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>7. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in
                     React?
                  </h2>
                  <p>Controlled components: These are React components where form elements
                     (like input, textarea, etc.) are controlled by React state. The state is the single
                     source of truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>Uncontrolled components: These are form elements that maintain their own
                     internal state and don't require React state management. You can interact with
                     the DOM directly using refs.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>8. What is React Context?
                  </h2>
                  <p>React Context is a way to share state across the component tree without
                     passing props down manually at every level. It's useful for global data like
                     theme, authentication, or language preferences.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div className='p-3'>
                  <h2 className='font-medium '>9. What is the key prop in React and why is it important? </h2>
                  <p>The key prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list or collection of
                     elements. It helps React optimize re-renders by efficiently comparing the
                     virtual DOM and determining which items have changed, been added, or been
                     removed.

                  <h2 className='font-medium '>10. What is Redux and how does it work with React? </h2>
                  <p>Redux is a state management library that can be used with React to manage
                     global state. It uses a central store to manage the state of an application, and
                     actions and reducers are used to modify that state. Redux follows the
                     principles of Flux architecture.

                  <h2 className='font-medium '>11. What is JSX and why is it used in React?
                  </h2>
                  <p>JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within
                     JavaScript. It provides a more intuitive way to define UI elements and
                     improves the readability of React components.

                  </h2>
                  <p>Pure components in React are components that only re-render when their
                     props or state have changed. They implement a shallow comparison of props
                     and state, making them more efficient than regular components.

                  </h2>
                  <p>Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere
                     in their child component tree, log the errors, and display a fallback UI. They
                     prevent crashes by isolating errors in specific parts of the component tree.

                  <p>componentDidMount is a lifecycle method used in class components that is
                     called after the component is mounted. useEffect in function components is
                     equivalent and can be configured to run once, on every render, or on specific
                     dependencies.

                  </h2>
                  <p>Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. It
                     compares the new virtual DOM with the previous version and makes changes
                     only to the DOM elements that need to be updated, improving performance.

                  <p>React Suspense is a feature that allows you to defer the loading of components
                     or data until they are ready. It is useful for implementing code splitting, where
                     chunks of code are only loaded when required, improving the application's
                     load time.

                  <p>React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents re-renders of function
                     components if their props haven't changed. It's useful for optimizing
                     performance in functional components.

                  <p>5. What is the difference between useCallback and useMemo?
                     useCallback is used to memoize functions, preventing their recreation on every render.
                     useMemo is used to memoize the result of a function, preventing unnecessary recalculations
                     on every render.

                  <p>state is an object that stores a component's dynamic data. Unlike props, state can
                     change over time, and when the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the
                     new state. In class components, state is initialized using this.state, and in function
                     components, state is managed using the useState hook.

                  </p>
                  <p>State: Mutable, managed within a component, and used to store dynamic data that
                     may change over time.

                  </h2>
                  <p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code
                     within JavaScript. It is commonly used in React components to describe the UI. JSX
                     is transformed into React createElement calls behind the scenes.

                  </h2>
                  <p>"Rendering" in React refers to the process of generating and updating the UI based on
                     changes to state or props. When a component's state or props change, React re
                     renders the component to update the DOM accordingly.

                  </h2>
                  <p>In class components, the render() method is required and returns the JSX that defines
                     the UI of the component. It is called automatically by React when the component's
                     state or props change.

                  <p>A stateless component is a component that does not manage its own state. It only
                     accepts props and renders UI based on those props. Function components are typically
                     stateless, though they can use hooks for state.

                  <p>A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. In modern React,
                     functional components can use hooks (like useState, useEffect, etc.) to manage state
                     and lifecycle events.

                  <p>A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component and includes
                     lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and
                     componentWillUnmount. It can manage its own state via this.state.

                  </h2>
                  <p>The key prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been
                     removed. This helps in efficiently re-rendering only the changed items in a list,
                     improving performance.

                  <p>A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a
                     new component with additional props or behavior. It's a pattern used for code reuse.
                     For example, withRouter is an HOC in React Router that injects routing props into a
                     component.

                  <p>Component lifecycle refers to the series of methods that are called at different stages
                     of a component's existence in React, including: 
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                  </p>
                  <p>componentDidUpdate() is called after any update to the component, either from props
                     or state changes. Itâ€™s used for reacting to changes in props or state.

                  </h2>
                  <p>Controlled components: These are components where the form element values (e.g.,
                     input, select, textarea) are controlled by React state. The value is set via state and
                     updated using onChange event handlers. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Uncontrolled components: These are components where the form element values
                     are handled by the DOM itself. You can access their values using refs but donâ€™t need
                     to store them in React state.

                  <p>React Context is a way to share state across the component tree without passing props
                     manually at every level. It is useful for global data (like authentication, theme,

                  </h2>
                  <p>React determines whether a component needs to re-render based on changes to its
                     state or props. If thereâ€™s a change, React schedules a re-render and performs a diffing
                     process to update the DOM efficiently (via the Virtual DOM). React will only re
                     render components whose state or props have changed.
